# pandas-challenge
PyCitySchools is the completed file to be graded.

Contains files for Module 4 Challenge, CWRU Bootcamp.
I relied heavily on the supplied PyCitySchools_starter Jupyter file as I completed this assignment, however, I did create my own Jupyter notebook. Other supplied files included schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv which were merged to create a combined DataFrame for analysis.

I familiarized myself with the use of https://chat.openai.com/ to answer my questions about how to perform certain tasks in pandas. The one thing I found there that was not covered in Bootcamp materials was df.nunique() which I found useful to count the number of schools in the data set.
